Hi,
I am an active and spontaneous civil engineer and like to go to great lengths to
bring out the best in people around me. That's why I fit in well
a workplace where honesty, inclusion and trust among colleagues have none
borders.
 
Science and technology have always impressed and challenged me to learn and
understand more. That's why I decided to become a civil engineer, something
who has made me a more humble and knowledgeable person and strengthened
my understanding of the world I live in.
 
In previous years, I have worked to make myself skilled in my field
with the help of my practical studies and not least the interesting ones
the positions I have held so far, in addition I have a great interest in running
as a volunteer to help spread interest in science among young and old.
 
I have previously worked with various tasks within
software development, web programming, APIs, machine learning,
network administration, database administration, and many others
assignments at the crossroads and television of various subject areas within
information technology. These experiences have made me more
solution-oriented and ready to take on greater challenges in the field.
 
I had an ambitious start to my career as an IT consultant
Profitbase Focus AS, where I have learned a lot and built interest in many
modern tools and computer technology such as Power BI, Power Apps, PowerShell
and not least React JS. Later I joined the development team
University of Stavanger with technical responsibility for the external websites
The University of Stavanger and its content management system.
 
I also have 4 years of experience as a store employee and customer service representative
mail in store at Rimi Eiganes in Stavanger. There I have learned to be a part
of the team and built good friendships.
 
I never fear new and unknown challenges, my strong point is the ability to
plan and perform work tasks in a very professional way,
along with my social skills to engage colleagues and others
people around me despite differences and varied interests.
